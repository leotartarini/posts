# What We're Watching

**Trump's Day:** President Trump visits California to be briefed on the wildfires. [At least 33 people have died](https://capitaljournal.createsend1.com/t/d-l-cjrzld-l-i/) from wildfires raging in the West. Later, he participates in a Latinos for Trump Coalition Roundtable in Phoenix, Ariz. Vice President Pence campaigns in Wisconsin.

**Biden's Day:** Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden delivers an address in Delaware about the wildfires, job creation and infrastructure. Sen. Kamala Harris campaigns in California.

**L.A. Manhunt:** A $100,000 reward has been authorized for information leading to the arrest and conviction of a [gunman who shot two Los Angeles County sheriff deputies](https://capitaljournal.createsend1.com/t/d-l-cjrzld-l-d/) several times Saturday night. Both deputies suffered critical injuries, officials said.

**Hurricane Season:** [Tropical Storm Sally](https://capitaljournal.createsend1.com/t/d-l-cjrzld-l-h/) is bearing down on the Gulf Coast of Louisiana and is expected to make landfall late Monday or early Tuesday, possibly as a Category 2 hurricane.

# Campaign 2020



**Joe Biden is proposing the most ambitious federal spending program of any major party’s presidential nominee in decades**, according to an analysis to be published today by the nonpartisan Penn Wharton Budget Model. If enacted, the Biden budget would elevate federal spending to 24% of gross domestic product by 2030, according to the Wharton study, [report Jacob M. Schlesinger and Eliza Collins](https://capitaljournal.createsend1.com/t/d-l-cjrzld-l-o/).

**Mr. Biden has pledged, if elected president, to transform U.S. policing**, using the Justice Department’s power to hold cities accountable for misconduct. That would be an about-face from Trump administration philosophy, [report Sabrina Siddiqui and Sadie Gurman](https://capitaljournal.createsend1.com/t/d-l-cjrzld-l-b/).

**President Trump signed an executive order on Sunday to reduce drug prices for seniors**, [report Andrew Restuccia and Thomas M. Burton](https://capitaljournal.createsend1.com/t/d-l-cjrzld-l-x/). Drug-pricing experts say that the best way to lower prices under Medicare is to grant the agency the legal authority to directly negotiate prices with drug companies. This measure wouldn’t do that.

**"It’s the economy, stupid" carries less weight in 2020**. Polling data show that views about the economy are driven by party affiliation rather than its actual performance. At the same time, issues including the Covid-19 pandemic, leadership style, race and social concerns are factoring heavily in the election choices of voters, diminishing the weight people say they place on the economy, [report Jon Hilsenrath and Aaron Zitner](https://capitaljournal.createsend1.com/t/d-l-cjrzld-l-m/).

> In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.

-   **Mr. Trump held his first indoor rally** in nearly three months on Sunday, ignoring Nevada’s social-distancing rules and [drawing the governor's ire](https://capitaljournal.createsend1.com/t/d-l-cjrzld-l-q/).

-   **Colorado won** a temporary restraining order [blocking the U.S. Postal Service](https://capitaljournal.createsend1.com/t/d-l-cjrzld-l-a/) from sending the state’s households a postcard about voting by mail, after its top election official said the information was misleading.

-   **The Democratic Party has** [moved to develop new virtual organizing tools](https://capitaljournal.createsend1.com/t/d-l-cjrzld-l-f/) to make use of supporters, but some worry that it doesn’t match Republicans’ canvassing efforts.
